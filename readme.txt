Thank you for choosing my product! Do not hesitate to contact me in case of any further questions or concerns.

== Installation ==

1. Unpack files from the patch you have purchased.
2. Copy folder 'kkprogress' to a folder on your own server. To do it you might want to use programs meant for establishing connection with FTP server (personally, I would recommend FileZilla program. You can find guide on how to use it here). All the data needed for establishing connection with FTP server should go together with a purchased server.
3. Next, log in to the administrative panel of your blog.
4. Go to the tab called 'Plugins'.
5. Find plug-in called 'KKILikeIt' and click on 'Activate'
6. On the left hand side, 'KK I Like It' tab should appear. From that tab, you can manage your plug-in.
